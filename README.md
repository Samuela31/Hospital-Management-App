# Hospital Management App

This is a team project done in my 1st year of college as part of our Industrial Revolution 4.0 course. Please view full report [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MXGhYqyxQwlb0uEpH0d_UEk1HMxM5CmR/view?usp=sharing). App code and Android Studio project files can be found in the hissss final.zip file. Output screenshots of our Android app can be found in the Progress folder. Media and pictures required for the app are stored in Drawable pics folder. 

## What App is this?
We have created an android application for a hospital to store patient details and patient history, which consists of login page for patients, doctors, admin, registration page for patients, doctors, appointment booking, etc using Android studio. All data is stored in Firebase database.

## Why this App?
- <b>Problem statement:</b> It is a hassle for patients to keep track of their previous doctor visits, previous symptoms and
medications taken. So it difficult for the doctor to diagnosis the patient accurately, hence patient treatment is less efficient. 

- <b>Objective:</b> To easily identify what the patient is suffering from and make accurate diagnosis quickly based on patient history. The doctor does not have to spend time asking how frequent the patient has been experiencing these symptoms, when it happened, what medications were taken, etc. Patient can also book and cancel appointments with ease, and doctors can get a clear view of their schedule. When more patients use this app, the hospital also generates more revenue.

## Technology Used/ Required
Android Studio, Firebase database, Android phone/ emulator

Note: To run the app in your phone, you should enable developer mode in phone settings and then install app from Android Studio by connecting your phone with Android Studio.
